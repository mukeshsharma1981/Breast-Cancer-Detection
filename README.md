Background

All of our bodies are composed of cells. The human body has about 100 trillion cells within it. And usually those cells behave in a certain way. However, occasionally, one of these 100 trillion cells, behave in a different way and keeps dividing and pushes the other cells around it out of the way. That cell stops observing the rules of the tissue within which it is located and begins to move out of its normal position and starts invading into the tissues around it and sometimes entering the bloodstream and becoming is called a metastasis.

In summary, as we grow older,throughout a lifetime, we go through this knid of situation where a particular kind of gene is mutated where the protein that it makes is abnormal and drives the cell to behave in a different way that we call cancer.

This is what Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg was observing and put together this dataset.

Can we predict whether a cell is Malignant or Benign?


# Conclusion from KNN and Support Vector Machine
## From KNN
* As we can see that for Benign it has wrongly classified as 1
* and for Malignant 5 are wrongly classified

## From SVM
* As we can see that for Benign it has wrongly classified as 2
* and for Malignant 2 are wrongly classified

# Final Conclusion from the two different Models Prediction:
* So Here we will go with Support Vector Machine Model and Recommend this to Dr Willian
* Next time if any new data will come so we will run that data on support vector machine model because it has
* a accuracy of 98% whereas KNN has a accuracy of 97%.
